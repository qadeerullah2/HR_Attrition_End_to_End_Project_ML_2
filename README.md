HR_Attrition_End_to_End_Project_ML_2 – Project Description
📌 Project Overview

The HR Attrition End-to-End Machine Learning Project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand why employees leave an organization and to predict future attrition using Machine Learning.

Employee attrition is a critical challenge for HR teams because it directly affects productivity, hiring costs, team morale, and business continuity.
This project uses real-world HR data to help organizations identify risk factors and take proactive actions to retain employees.

🎯 Project Objectives
